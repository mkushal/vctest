Allow listing process:
Any white/allow list changes need to be vetted by the Vodacom's IT Network Security team.

If Application teams require a URL to be added to the white/allow list they need to follow the process below.

Send a mail to the IT Network Security team: itnetworksecurity@vodacom.co.za

Include a description of your requirements and list the domain/s you need whitelisted as per the example below.

Note the wildcard is a “.”

CC in the request: mark.warr@vodacom.co.za

Please do not CC Cloud Support in the request as this team is not able to assist with whitelisting changes.

The domain will be whitelisted on the firewall immediately at the time the IT Network Security team complete the change ie: there is no delay as there used to be with the Squid proxy.

Sample comms:

Hi team

Please whitelist the below domain/s on the AWS egress firewall.

Domain: “.example.com”

Thanks.
